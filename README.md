# Animal Crossing Music 🍀
#### This is continuation of the original [Animal Crossing Music](https://github.com/animal-crossing-music-extension/Animal-Crossing-Music-Extension) project, which is no longer maintained.
 
**Animal Crossing Music** is a a fun Chrome extension for playing Animal Crossing's
music in the browser, while you work, play or browse the web! ✨

The music updates in real-time on the hour, and informs you via an optional desktop notification and customizable town tune! 🌱

## Features
### Hourly music 🕒
Listen to the corresponding hourly music from the main Animal Crossing titles:
  - Animal Crossing
  - Wild World / City Folk
  - New Leaf

'Raining' and 'snowing' variants are also included!

### Live Weather 🌧
You can enable Weather Detection so weather variants of the hourly music can be automatically picked according to the weather in your location!

### K.K. Slider 🎙
Listen to K.K. Slider's songs! The extension features both 'live' and 'aircheck' version of his tunes.

You can choose whether to keep his appearances to the usual Saturday nights, or to play his songs 24/7.


### Town Tune 🎵
The extension features an awesome Town Tune editor available within the browser.

With it you can compone your custom Town Tune, which will be played every time an hour passes (just as in the game!)

The extension no longer contains music files, and the source code does not depend on resources hosted elsewhere.
